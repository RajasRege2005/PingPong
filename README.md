# PingPong
Using python, i have created a ping pong game which can be played by two people simultaneously.
The game contains two sliders/paddles which can hit the ball.
Once a paddle hits the ball, the player gets a point which is updated on the main screen.
If the ball leaves the screen, the player opposite to the screen end gets a point and the ball starts from the middle again, this time going towards the player who just scored.
The game has no score limit, so the players can play it for a long time!
Enjoy:)
